                <h1 id="top">The Standard Library</h1>
                <p>
                    The StackLang standard library is composed of two parts - the extended command set for primitive types (see individual primitive
                    type pages for more information), and the set of utility commands. By default both parts are automatically
                    included, but running the interpreter with the
                    <code>-b</code> option will turn off this automatic inclusion. Both parts are written in StackLang, and can be found
                    in
                    <code>libs/std.sta</code>, as well as files included from that file. (The official implementation splits off many of the extended
                    command set into separate files.)
                </p>
                <h2 id="utility">Utility Functions</h2>
                <p>
                    These functions are provided as being commonly used. They are not associated with any particular type, but are generally
                    useful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>equal? : Any Any -> Boolean</code>
                    <br/> Produces true if given elements are of the same type and equal (according to that type's equality command)
                    or equivalent (if such a command doesn't make sense - for example, with substacks).
                </p>
                <h2 id="map">Associative Substacks</h2>
                <p>
                    Any Associative substack is any substack whose elements are all composed of a substack of two elements, and all of those
                    individual elements has the first element the same type as any other.
                </p>

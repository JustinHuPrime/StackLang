                <h1 id="top">The Language</h1>
                <h2 id="stack">The Stack</h2>
                <p> The core of StackLang is the stack. The stack is where any and all data your program will operate on will
                    be stored. The prompt will add elements to the stack. After an element has been added to the stack, it
                    is evaluated (see below). </p>
                <h2 id="defines">Definitions</h2>
                <p> The only state that StackLang recognizes (under standard conditions, and excluding <code>include</code>)
                    is defined functions. A defined function has four parts - a signature, its body, a context (is set to
                    the global context when defined using <code>define</code>), and a name. </p>
                <h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation Rules</h2>
                <p> If the top element of the stack is not an unquoted command, evaluation stops and waits for further input.
                    If the top item is a primitive command (`plus`, `divide`, `swap`, other built-ins), then the types of
                    the arguments are checked (and a <code>TypeError</code> raised if the arguments are invalid), then the
                    command and the arguments to the command are popped off of the stack, and the command executed by the
                    interpreter. If the top item is a defined command (a user defined command or a command defined by an
                    included file), then the interpreter looks up the command body to go with the command name. Then, the
                    interpreter checks that the command has the correct context (from what command was this command invoke),
                    and checks the types. A <code>SyntaxError</code> or a <code>TypeError</code>, respectively, will be raised
                    if those checks fail. Next, the interpreter takes the body of the definition, and places each element
                    from that body onto the stack, evaluating after every placement. If the command entered does not exist,
                    then a <code>SyntaxError</code> is raised. </p>
                <h3 id="errors">Errors</h3>
                <p> StackLang, unfortunately, does not currently support error handling. Any errors are fatal, and will result
                    with the stack left in an unpredictable state. </p>
                <h3 id="preprocessor">The Preprocessor</h3>
                <p> Files included using the <code>include</code> command are first preprocessed. The file to be read is read
                    line by line. Anything after a <code>;</code> outside of a string is discarded. If the current line does
                    not contain a <code>&lt;&lt;</code> as it's only text has its whitespace trimmed and is then passed to
                    the parser as if it were typed in via the interpreter. If the line is a start of substack marker on its
                    own, then the start of substack marker is added to the buffer, and the preprocessor looks at the next
                    line. If that next line is a close of substack marker, then the substack marker is appended to the current
                    buffer, and the buffer is passed to the interpreter. If the next line is not a close of substack marker,
                    and if the buffer is currently just a start of substack marker, then the next line is appended onto the
                    current line. If the buffer is not just an opening substack marker, then the next element is appended
                    with a comma. If the preprocessor encounters a start of substack marker on one line within the substack,
                    then the preprocessor is recursively invoked to read that substack. </p>

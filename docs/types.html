                <p>
                    StackLang is a statically typed language. This typing is enforced with latent typing. There are six basic types in StackLang:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://justinhuprime.github.io/StackLang/booleans.html">Booleans</a>: Booleans are either
                            <code>true</code> or
                            <code>false</code>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://justinhuprime.github.io/StackLang/commands.html">Commands</a>: Commands are either the name of a primitive function or the named of a defined
                            function.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://justinhuprime.github.io/StackLang/numbers.html">Numbers</a>: StackLang numbers are arbitrary precision rational numbers. All StackLang numbers
                            are displayed as fractions or as integers. However, numbers can be parsed as decimals or as fractions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://justinhuprime.github.io/StackLang/strings.html">Strings</a>: A StackLang string is an arbitrarily long string of ASCII characters.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://justinhuprime.github.io/StackLang/substacks.html">Substacks</a>: Substacks are a way to "group" stack elements together in StackLang. Stacks are
                            similar to lists in Lisp, Scheme, and Racket - they can only be operated on from one end, and
                            can be decomposed by getting the top and the rest of the substack.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://justinhuprime.github.io/StackLang/typeElements.html">Types</a>: StackLang has a limited capability for reflection - it is able to get the type of
                            an element and manipulate that information. A type is one of the six primitive types, or the
                            special
                            <code>Any</code> type.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    Functions and commands check for the correct number and type of arguments before being evaluated, so any arity of type errors
                    will be caught at the soonest time possible. When this happens, a
                    <code>TypeError</code> is thrown.
                </p>
                <h2 id="specialization">Type Specialziation</h2>
                <p>
                    A type specialziation is when there is additional information after the type in parenthesis. For example, a
                    <code>Command(Quoted)</code> is a quoted command. Substacks, commands, and numbers may have specialized types. (This means that their
                    type has additional information, and that the element itself has some different forms possible). Substacks
                    may be specialized to indicate what type they can hold. In between the parenthesis should be another
                    type (including further specialized types). For example,
                    <code>Substack(String)</code> is a substack of strings. A
                    <code>Substack(Substack(Number(Inexact)))</code> is a substack of substacks of inexact numbers - a 2d grid of inexact numbers. An unspecialized Substack
                    is a substack of any type. Numbers can be specialized with their exactness. The three allowed Number
                    types are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <code>Number</code>: An unspecialized number - may be either exact or inexact.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>Number(Exact)</code>: An exact number.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>Number(Inexact)</code>: An inexact number.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    Commannds are specialized when quoted. The two allowed command types are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <code>Command</code>: An unspecialized command, either quoted or not.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>Command(Quoted)</code>: A specialized, quoted command.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>Command(Unquoted)</code>: A specialized, quoted command.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

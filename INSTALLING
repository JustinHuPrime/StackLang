The interpreter requires the following libraries. Please install these libraries
and their dependencies for your particular system:

* ncurses
* Catch2 (included as git submodile in extern)

You will also need the following tools:

* A C++17 capable compiler (clang++ or g++ preferred)
* gnu-make

Then, edit the included makefile to specify the appropriate shell commands and
library links for your particular system, as well as setting the appropriate
warning flags for your compiler.

Finally, run `make clean`, then `make debug` or `make release`. This will
compile the interpreter, run the included test suite, and should produce both
the `stacklang` executable, and the `stacklangTest` executable.
